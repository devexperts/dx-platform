## @devexperts/lint
Infrastucture confuguration files, to have consistent linting rules across different Devexperts frontend team projects. Those files are:

* `tslint.json`
* `.prettierrc.json`
* `tsconfig.json`? - _I'm not even sure that we need to have this file here, it's more like part of `@devexperts/tools`_
